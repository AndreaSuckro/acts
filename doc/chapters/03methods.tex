\chapter{Methods}
The used model is inspired by the network presented in \ref{huang2017lung} and performs with an accuracy of around 80$\%$. 


\section{Software Packages}
The whole programming is done in Python 3.6. 

Use of conda for the environment management 

TensorFlow for the network architecture and computation

Sun Grid Engine of the Institute for the calculations on the grid

\section{Convolutional Neural Network}
The current network structure consists of
