\chapter{Results}\label{chap:results}
Write about what the final network and it's performance.

\section{The trained Network}
The used model is inspired by the network presented in \cite{huang2017lung} and performs with an accuracy of around 76$\%$ on the validation set the false positive rate is $0.1$ per sample.
Show performance of the network and all metrics about number of epochs etc.


\section{Analyzing the Network}
To understand how a network solves the task it makes sense to look at the patterns it's layers a sensitive to. The convolutional layers allow for visual inspection.
Focus on the conv layers, what do they look like? Any hint on the geometry they are sensitive to?
Activation patterns to synthetic data and patches from the patients.

\section{Bridge to other Approaches}
How could a comparison at all be achieved? What is hindering the straightforward comparison of the kernel weights? Draw out a method to do that
Show what has been done
Compare performance to hand crafted approaches, 
take numbers out of papers

what could be similar features in the network?
