\chapter{Current Approaches}\label{chap:approaches}
This chapter illustrates the current state of the art in the field of automated nodule detection. Roughly the field can be divided among the used methods in the \emph{classical} approaches and the deep learning approaches. It also describes the difference in methodology that this thesis is using and the target.

\section{Classical Approaches}
Link and describe in greater detail the approaches found in the classic filter selection pipelines.

\section{Neural Network Approaches}
Papers that deal with the neural network approach are explained here.

\section{Delimitation}
Where can this thesis be positioned in this field? Lung CT analysis and nodule detection have 


Question: can lung nodule detection be done by neural networks? Can it be done by 3d convolutional neural networks? Can any further insight be gained from it?

Network only approach.

3D kernels for network. 

Nodule detection in the sense of yes/no not classification of other features like malignancy.
