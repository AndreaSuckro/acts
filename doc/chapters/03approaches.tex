\chapter{Current Approaches}\label{chap:approaches}
This chapter illustrates the current state of the art in the field of automated nodule detection. Roughly the field can be divided among the used methods in the \emph{classical} approaches and the deep learning approaches. It also describes the difference in methodology that this thesis is using.

\section{Classical Approaches}
Link and describe in greater detail the approaches found in the classic filter selection pipelines.

\section{Neural Network}
Papers that deal with the neural network approach are explained here.

\section{Delimitation}
Network only approach.

3D network. 

Nodule detection in the sense of yes/no not classification of other features like malignancy.
