\chapter{Results}\label{chap:04results}
Write about what the final network uses as features.
\section{Learned features}
Focus on the conv layers, what do they look like? Any hint on the geometry they are sensitive to?
Activation patterns to synthetic data and patches from the patients.

\section{Performance Comparison}
How could a comparison at all be achieved? What is hindering the straightforward comparison of the kernel weights? Draw out a method to do that
Show what has been done
Compare performance to hand crafted approaches, 
take numbers out of papers

what could be similar features in the network?
